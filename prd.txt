ClaimIQ – AI-Powered Instant Motor Claim Pre-Approval System

1️⃣ Product Overview
🎯 Vision

ClaimIQ is an AI-powered insurance claim intelligence platform that analyzes vehicle damage images and provides instant repair cost estimation, fraud risk scoring, and automated pre-approval decisions.

It reduces claim processing time from days to minutes.

🚨 Problem Statement

Insurance motor claims are:

Slow (manual inspection required)

Prone to fraud

Inconsistent in cost estimation

Operationally expensive

We solve this by:

Automated damage detection

AI-based cost estimation

Fraud similarity detection

Decision automation

2️⃣ Objectives (Hackathon Scope)
Primary Goals

Upload vehicle damage images

Detect damaged parts + severity

Estimate repair cost

Detect potential fraud

Provide automated approval decision

Generate claim summary report

3️⃣ Target Users

Insurance companies

Claims processing teams

Motor insurance policy holders

InsurTech startups

5️⃣ Core Features
🔹 Feature 1: Image Upload & Storage
Description

Users upload one or multiple car damage images.

Requirements

Accept JPG/PNG

Store in Supabase Storage

Create new claim entry in DB

🔹 Feature 2: Damage Detection Model
Description

Detect damaged car parts and severity.

Technical Implementation

YOLOv8 pretrained model (fine-tuned if possible)

Output:

Part name (bumper, hood, headlight)

Bounding box

Severity classification (minor/moderate/severe)

Output Example
{
  "part": "Rear Bumper",
  "severity": "Moderate",
  "confidence": 0.87
}
🔹 Feature 3: Vision LLM Reasoning Agent
Description

Explain detected damage in natural language.

Input

Image

Detected parts

Output Example

"The rear bumper shows moderate deformation consistent with low-speed rear collision. Paint damage is visible and likely requires replacement."

This boosts innovation score.

🔹 Feature 4: Cost Estimation Engine
Logic

Cost =
(Part Base Cost × Severity Multiplier)

Labor Cost
× Regional Multiplier

Example Cost Table
Part	Minor	Moderate	Severe
Bumper	3000	6000	12000
Headlight	2500	5000	9000

Stored in Supabase table.

Output

Itemized breakdown

Total cost

🔹 Feature 5: Fraud Detection Module
Objective

Detect suspicious claims.

Methods (Hackathon Scope)

Image embedding similarity (CLIP)

Compare with previous claims

If similarity > 0.92 → Flag duplicate

Claim frequency logic

If user > 3 claims in 6 months → Risk increase

Damage inconsistency

Severe model detection + “minor” user description

Output

Fraud Score: 0–100

🔹 Feature 6: Decision Engine
Logic

Auto Approve If:

Fraud score < 30

Cost < threshold (e.g., ₹15,000)

Manual Review If:

Fraud score 30–70

Cost high

Reject If:

Fraud score > 80

Duplicate image detected

Output Example
Decision: Pre-Approved
Confidence: 92%
Risk Level: Low
🔹 Feature 7: Dashboard UI

Must Display:

Uploaded image

Highlighted damage

Severity labels

Cost breakdown chart

Fraud score gauge

Final decision badge

AI explanation text

🔹 Feature 8: PDF Claim Report Generator

Generate downloadable report including:

Claim ID

Damage summary

Cost breakdown

Fraud score

Decision status

AI explanation
